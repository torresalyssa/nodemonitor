                <h3>Install</h3>
                <p>
                    This will check whether or not you have PM2 (the tool used to report monitoring information on your
                    project), your project, Node.js, npm, and bower installed. If any of these are not detected, you
                    will need to click the corresponding button(s) to install them. This page will offer to
                    install your project from the <tt>git_repo</tt> listed in your <tt>config.json</tt> file if there is
                    no local install. <br>
                    If you get an error message while trying to install, make sure that you have
                    admin privileges.<br>
                    Make sure there is a check mark next to each dependency before proceeding with the use
                    if this app. If all are not installed, some functionality will be lost.

                <h3>Basic Dashboard</h3>
                <p>
                    The first item listed on the basic dashboard indicates your project and its status (running or
                    not running). When your project is not running, you can try to start it by clicking the start
                    icon. When your project is running, you can stop it or restart it by clicking the icons
                    corresponding to those actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second item listed on the basic dashboard represents the watchdog (PM2) that is monitoring your
                    app. The icon to the left indicates whether or not the watchdog is active (whether or not PM2 is
                    reporting monitoring information to the PM2 endpoint given in the <tt>config.json</tt> file).
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Advanced Dashboard</h3>
                <p>
                    The advanced dashboard allows you to view more detailed information on the status of your app,
                    including a list of all running processes, the ability to start/stop/reset any process, and CPU
                    and memory usage information.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Update</h3>
                <p>
                    Click the Check for Updates button to see if your git project is up-to-date.
                    Click the update button to update your local version of the git project located at the git project
                    path (<tt>project_path</tt>) given in the <tt>config.json</tt> file. The update process will pull the
                    latest version of the project and run  <tt>npm update</tt>'s and  <tt>bower update</tt>'s as needed.
                </p>

                <h3>Configuration File (<tt>config.json</tt>)</h3>

                <tt>ping_endpt</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Endpoint for your project. Used to ping and determine if the
                project is running.<br>

                <tt>project_name</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of your project. Used only for UI purposes.<br>

                <tt>pm2_endpt</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Where PM2 is reporting its monitoring information to.<br>

                <tt>project_path</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolute path to your project. If this is left blank/empty, then
                it is assumed that there is no local install of the project and you will need to go to the Install
                page to clone the project from the given <tt>git_repo</tt>.<br>

                <tt>main_project_file</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;File to be started via <tt>pm2 start</tt> in order to
                run your project. Must be located in the root  of the project directory.

                <tt>git_repo</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the git repository for this project. Used to install
                the project if there is no local install, i.e. there is no <tt>project_path</tt>.

                <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Issue:</b>&nbsp;I got an error when trying to install PM2/Node.js/Bower<br>
                    <b>Solution:</b>&nbsp;This most likely means that you are not running with administrative privileges.
                    Make sure you are logged in to your computer as an administrator and try again. If that still does not
                    work, make sure that you are connected to the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Issue:</b>&nbsp;The watchdog is indicating that it is not running.<br>
                    <b>Solution:</b>&nbsp;This could mean that you have the wrong PM2 endpoint in your <tt>config.json</tt>
                    file. Check this by making sure that the port number output by PM2 when you run <tt>pm2 web</tt>
                    in the terminal matches that given in your <tt>config.json</tt> under <tt>pm2_endpt</tt>. Another reason this may
                    occur is that you do not have PM2 installed. Check the Install page to see if you have PM2 installed,
                    and if not click the button to install it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Issue:</b>&nbsp;The watchdog is indicating that it is running, but my app is indicating it is not.<br>
                    <b>Solution:</b>&nbsp;This means that you have PM2 running a different app and reporting monitoring
                    information on that app to the PM2 endpoint. To fix this, run <tt>pm2 kill</tt> in your
                    terminal, navigate to your project's main <tt>.js</tt> file, run <tt>pm2 start [main app file]</tt>, and
                    finally run <tt>pm2 web</tt> to have PM2 start reporting to the PM2 endpoint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Issue:</b>&nbsp;It says "Error reading configuration file."<br>
                    <b>Solution:</b>&nbsp;This usually means that you either do not have a config.json file located in
                    the root of this app, or if you do that it is ill-formed or empty. To fix this, make sure you have a
                    config.json file in the root directory of this app and that it has the format described above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Issue:</b>&nbsp;I got an error checking for updates.<br>
                    <b>Solution:</b>&nbsp;This most likely means that the project indicated by your <tt>project_path</tt>
                    does not have a git repository. Make sure that your project has a git repository and that the
                    <tt>project_path</tt> (visible from the App Configuration page) is correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Issue:</b>&nbsp;I got an error updating.<br>
                    <b>Solution:</b>&nbsp;One reason this could happen is if the <tt>project_path</tt> is not an absolute
                    path to your project. Make sure the project path is NOT a relative path by looking at the Configuration
                    page. An error while updating could also mean that you do not have Bower and/or npm installed. Check
                    the install page to verify they are installed and install if they are not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Issue:</b>&nbsp;An install button is disabled.<br>
                    <b>Solution:</b>&nbsp;First, refresh the page. Any buttons that are disabled without a check mark and
                    a message next to them saying they are already installed are dependencies that cannot be installed
                    until some other dependency is installed. Make sure that you click on the non-disabled buttons to
                    install those dependencies first, and once that is done you will be able to install the others.
