                <p>
                    This will check whether or not you have PM2 (the tool used to report monitoring
                    information on your project) installed. If it is not detected on your computer,
                    a button will show up that you can click to install PM2, which is necessary for
                    this app to be able to supply you with monitoring information. Additionally, this page will offer to install your project from git if there is
                    no local install. <br><br>
                    If you get an error message while trying to install PM2, make sure that you have
                    permission to install programs globally on your computer.

                <h3>Basic Dashboard</h3>
                <p>
                    The first item listed on the basic dashboard indicates your project and its status (running or
                    not running). When your project is not running, you can try to start it by clicking the start
                    icon. When your project is running, you can stop it or restart it by clicking the icons
                    corresponding to those actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second item listed on the basic dashboard represents the watchdog (PM2) that is monitoring your
                    app. The icon to the left indicates whether or not the watchdog is active (whether or not PM2 is
                    reporting monitoring information to the PM2 endpoint given in the <tt>config.json</tt> file).
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Advanced Dashboard</h3>
                <p>
                    The advanced dashboard allows you to view more detailed information on the status of your app,
                    including a list of all running processes, the ability to start/stop/reset any process, and CPU
                    and memory usage information.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Update</h3>
                <p>
                    Click the Check for Updates button to see if your git project is up-to-date.
                    Click the update button to update your local version of the git project located at the git project
                    path (<tt>project_path</tt>) given in the <tt>config.json</tt> file. The update process will pull the
                    latest version of the project and run  <tt>npm update</tt>'s and  <tt>bower update</tt>'s as needed.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Configuration File (<tt>config.json</tt>)</h3>

                <tt>ping_endpt</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Endpoint for your project. Used to ping and determine if the
                project is running.<br>

                <tt>project_name</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of your project.<br>

                <tt>pm2_endpt</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Where PM2 is reporting its monitoring information to.<br>

                <tt>project_path</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Local path to your project.<br>

                <tt>main_project_file</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;File to be started via <tt>pm2 start</tt> in order to
                run your project. Must be located in the root project directory given by <tt>project_path</tt>.

                <tt>git_repo</tt>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the git repository for this project. Used to install
                the project if there is no local install, i.e. there is no <tt>project_path</tt>.

                <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Issue:</b>&nbsp;The watchdog is indicating that it is not running.<br>
                    <b>Solution:</b>&nbsp;This could mean that you did not tell PM2 to start reporting data to the PM2
                    endpoint. Do this by typing the command <tt>pm2 web</tt> into your terminal. Another reason the
                    watchdog could not be running is that you have the wrong PM2 endpoint in your <tt>config.json</tt>
                    file. Check this by making sure that the port number output by PM2 when you run <tt>pm2 web</tt>
                    matches that given in your <tt>config.json</tt> under <tt>pm2_endpt</tt>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Issue:</b>&nbsp;The watchdog is indicating that it is running, but my app is indicating it is not.<br>
                    <b>Solution:</b>&nbsp;This means that you have PM2 running a different app and reporting monitoring
                    information on that app to the PM2 endpoint. To fix this, run <tt>pm2 kill</tt> in your
                    terminal, navigate to your project's main <tt>.js</tt> file, run <tt>pm2 start [main app file]</tt>, and
                    finally run <tt>pm2 web</tt> to have PM2 start reporting to the PM2 endpoint.
                </p>
